This is a **VERY OLD** project of mine.

Deployment: https://advanced-lottie-viewer.vercel.app/

The code is a mess, and I'd like to eventually re-create this into an actual JavaScript library. Please don't judge the code quality here- it's quite embarrassing. I just wanted to share this old project of mine. I'd eventually like to re-create this, but it's pretty low priority for me.

This tool is meant to demonstrate the power of Lottie. I created this animation with Adobe Illustrator and After Effects, and I am using a custom JavaScript function that allows you to define "segments" of the animation, along with different "exit points" for each segment.
